# Brain-Tumor-Detection-And-Segmentation-Using-MRI-Image
# 🧠 Brain Tumor Detection and Segmentation Using MRI Images

## 📌 Project Overview

This project presents a deep learning-based system for **Brain Tumor Detection** and **Brain Tumor Segmentation** using MRI images.

The project consists of two independent modules:

- **Brain Tumor Detection (Classification)** using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
- **Brain Tumor Segmentation** using the nnU-Net framework.

The primary objective is to assist in the automatic detection and localization of brain tumors from MRI scans, helping improve the accuracy and efficiency of medical image analysis.

## 📂 Dataset

A custom brain MRI dataset was created by combining multiple publicly available brain tumor datasets.

**Note**

- The complete dataset (~5 GB) is **not included** in this repository because it exceeds GitHub's file size limits.
- Users should prepare the dataset with the required folder structure before running the notebooks.
